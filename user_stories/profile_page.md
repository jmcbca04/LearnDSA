# User Story: Profile Page

## As a User
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to access a profile page where I can view basic information about my account so that I can easily see my personal details.
  - **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - The profile page displays the user's name, email, and profile picture.
    - Users can access and view their profile from a designated link or menu option.
    - The layout is simple and mobile-friendly.

The functionality and layout of everything else in the app should remain the same. Please just add this feature on top of the existing functionality, layout, and styling.
